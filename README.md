# Backroads App Refactor

[![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)](https://lbesson.mit-license.org)

## Description

This project was aimed at practicing refactoring existing code into a react.js app. This challenge had a singular purpose of getting me more comfortable working with react.js. This is my first time working with the React library and future iterations will be refactoring a project I did myself and creating new projects from scratch using the React.js library.
